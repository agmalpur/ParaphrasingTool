# Paraphrasing Tool for Low-Resource Languages  

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a paraphrasing tool for low-resource languages, focusing on Marathi. The tool will transform complex sentences into simpler ones while maintaining their meaning, helping with language learning, NLP applications, and text simplification.  

## Features  
- **Sentence Validation:** Ensures input sentences conform to the dataset.  
- **Paraphrasing Engine:** Uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and synonym replacement.  
- **Evaluation System:** Measures similarity between original and paraphrased sentences.  
- **Dataset Management:** Supports dataset expansion for improved paraphrasing.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NLTK, IndoWordNet, mahaNLP  
- **Platform:** Google Colab, Spyder  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Transformer-based models, LSTM  

## Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/paraphrasing-tool.git
   cd paraphrasing-tool
   ```  
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the tool  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

## System Requirements  
- **Hardware:** Minimum 4GB RAM, Core i3 processor  
- **Software:** Python 3.x, Google Colab (recommended)  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement lemmatization for better word replacement  
- Expand dataset for improved paraphrasing  
- Enhance semantic understanding using deep learning models
